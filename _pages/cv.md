## Work Experience
**Researcher @ North Dakota State University (Statistics Department) (_August 2021 - August 2024_)**
- Proposed an empirical likelihood test for detecting community structure in both weighted and unweighted networks, addressing limitations in conventional hypothesis testing approaches focused primarily on unweighted networks.
- Utilized R programming for advanced statistical analysis, including the computation of test statistics, empirical likelihood ratio distributions, and p-values, while evaluating type I error rates and the power of the empirical likelihood test against traditional statistical frameworks by conducting 500 simulations. 
- Extended simulations to weighted networks using Beta and Gamma distributions for edge weights, analyzing test accuracy and power for different probabilities.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant @ North Dakota State University (_August 2021 - August 2024_)**
- 3 years of experience in conducting 10+ laboratory sessions
per semester for classes of 25+ students using JMP software for courses such as Introduction to Statistics and Regression Analysis, providing hands-on training in statistical methodologies.
- Assessed and evaluated student performance through grading and offering constructive feedback, enhancing their statistical understanding and problem-solving skills.
- Facilitated tutoring sessions focused on improving students' grasp of data analysis and statistical concepts, fostering academic development.

**Deputy Director of Pricing & Analytics Team @ Chaldal Limited (_October 2018 - July 2021_)**
- Led a 10-member team responsible for pricing over 4,000 products, optimizing strategies to increase profitability while reducing the product pricing update cycle from 72 hours to 24 hours.
- Established a 5-member analytics team, leveraging SQL and Excel to generate data-driven insights, enabling strategic decisions on consumer behavior and market trends.
- 2.5+ years of experience in defining and tracking key performance metrics across multiple business units, focusing on clear visualizations using BI tools to enhance decision-making for senior management.
- Designed and implemented a fraud detection system to identify and mitigate risks within 24 hours, saving costs and improving operational efficiency by enabling rapid financial audits and risk assessments.
- Conducted SQL and Excel training for 30+ team members, empowering cross-functional teams to independently generate reports and data solutions, thereby increasing data accessibility and driving business innovation.
- Reconciled and analyzed disparate data sources to detect inconsistencies, enabling accurate financial modeling, risk forecasting, and the identification of critical business risks.
- Created specifications for over 20 reports and dashboards, aligning with business needs and available data elements, enhancing decision-making accuracy for senior management.

**Data Analyst & Growth Hacker @ Rokomari.com (_April 2016 - August 2018_)**
- Structured and optimized CRM analytics to enhance data collection and analysis, supporting strategic decision-making in both pre- and post-branding performance evaluation.
- Utilized product analytics to track and interpret user activity across web and app platforms, driving the optimization of digital experiences based on behavioral insights.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards, ensuring the clear visualization of metrics for senior leadership and supporting data-driven decision-making.
- Curated and executed growth hacking strategies through the design and analysis of A/B tests for 30+ experiments, leveraging statistical analysis to evaluate and optimize experiments.
- 2+ years of experience in generating financial reports and providing actionable insights for monthly and quarterly business reviews, contributing to business growth and operational efficiency.
  
## Projects
### Testing Community Structure With Empirical Likelihood
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/testing-community-structure-with-empirical/docview/3106288393/se-2?accountid=201395))

Designed and evaluated a novel empirical likelihood test for detecting community structure in network data, demonstrating superior statistical power through extensive simulations compared to existing methods.
This absence of a community within the network has inspired us to explore and address this issue and motivate us to test the existence of community structure through our thesis research.

### Exploring E-Commerce Reviews on Amazon using Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) For Sentiment and Recommendation Analysis
#[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

This project aimed to explore the relationship between various variables in Amazon product reviews, employing univariate and multivariate analyses alongside a bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-short-term memory (LSTM) units for recommendation and sentiment classification.
