- Proposed an empirical likelihood test for detecting community structure in both weighted and unweighted networks, addressing limitations in conventional hypothesis testing approaches focused primarily on unweighted networks.
- Utilized R programming for advanced statistical analysis, including the computation of test statistics, empirical likelihood ratio distributions, and p-values, while evaluating type I error rates and the power of the empirical likelihood test against traditional statistical frameworks by conducting 500 simulations. 
- Extended simulations to weighted networks using Beta and Gamma distributions for edge weights, analyzing test accuracy and power for different probabilities.
